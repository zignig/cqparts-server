# cqparts-server
Proxy server and file watcher for cparts

This is an adjunct server to the cqparts project.

https://github.com/fragmuffin/cqparts

define a CQPARTS_SERVER=http://localhost:8080 as an enviromental variable
and the latest version of cqparts will post to it and update a threejs 
window automagically.

needs a golang dev environment and gb (https://github.com/constabulary/gb) for building. 

I will try to do binary release once it has settled.
